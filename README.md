# Temperature-Sensor
Our group constructed a thermometer and hygrometer, and a microcontroller selected ESP32. Using a breadboard and wires with other hardware parts we were able to use a sensor as a reading for temperature and humidity. The data is displayed on the OLED Display module, using Arduino code, we were able to implement the software into the hardware for proper use of the code.
Using the Arduino code assigned we were able to use it for the hardware, for the sensor and OLED Display to be used properly.  By leveraging sensor technology, we navigate the path toward a reliable and user-friendly system that caters to diverse environments. This introduction sets the stage for exploring a temperature and humidity that values practicality without compromising precision.
